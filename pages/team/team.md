The CoreTeam Experience will help your team move to new heights of performance. Our approach will accelerate the growth of the team through an action packed 4 day experience that will challenge you as an individual, galvanize your team, and create an executable plan for success.

You will experience key principles of team performance through hands on exercises and group assignments.&nbsp;

You will also experience the power of the group to accomplish more than what one individual could do alone.

You will have fun!&nbsp; The program is fast paced, interactive, and full of highly accomplished speakers and team coaches.

## **INDIVIDUAL LEADERSHIP**
