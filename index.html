      <h2>About</h2>
        <p>We are a fun group of talented artists that deeply care about making a difference.  While working at various establishments â€“ retail, healthcare, and academia, we saw how important programs, services, and ideas received little attention or engagement. Beneficial resources for students, employees and patients went untouched, their main sources of promotion being overlooked posters, buried webpages, and flyers left to skid across parking lots. Our mission at Rivet Visual is to create attention-grabbing content that ensures these programs do not go unnoticed. </p>
